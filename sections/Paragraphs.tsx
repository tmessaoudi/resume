        I’m based in France, but comfortable working remotely. I’m driven by solving tough problems whether it’s
        squeezing out extra performance in a data-heavy application or designing solutions for uncommon issues that
        don’t fit the usual patterns.

        Recently, I built a dicom web viewer in React and TypeScript that visualizes complex processing pipelines in
        real time. That experience sharpened my performance-optimization skills and end-to-end engineering chops-scaling
        the solution with containerization and ensuring a smooth user experience under heavy load.

        I’ve tackled challenges across diverse industries like automotive, telecom, research labs, voucher systems, and
        healthcare Always bringing curiosity and an emphasis on clean, maintainable code. What really drives me is
        architecting systems that perform today and adapt as requirements evolve. If you’re looking for someone who can
        dive into complex systems, scale them effectively, and deliver robust solutions, let’s connect.
